### Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

Configure the `Build and Deployment` to have a `Source` of `Deploy from a branch` and select the `main` branch for deployment. Deployments can take a few minutes, so get started on the lab, and then be sure to check the deployment after you have made a few commits.
